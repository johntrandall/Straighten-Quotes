# Straighten Quotes

A very simple sublime-text-3 plugin/package that straigtens quotes. This makes my life easier when converting source content into HTML, etc.

Original code (which is, as of now, unmodified) came from a forum post here - https://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=14451.
